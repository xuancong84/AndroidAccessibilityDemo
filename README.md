**Android Accessibility Demo**

This demo is used to explore and test what information Android assessibility service can capture on screen touches and events.
You need to look at the logcat for all message logs.

The UI uses accessibility overlay, it presents 5 buttons:
- SHOW/HIDE: toggles show/hide the panel
- -: decrement verbosity
- [0-3]: the current verbosity level, click to toggle message logging
- +: increment verbosity
- EXIT: disable the accessibility service

Accessibility service can be used in APPs that collect features for digital phenotyping.
